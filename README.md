## 💰 The Problem: $300B+ Lost Annually to Billing Errors and Fraud

Healthcare payers lose **hundreds of billions annually** to improper payments, upcoding, duplicate services, and outright fraud. Traditional methods catch only 30-40% of problematic claims, and almost always *after* payment has been made—when recovery becomes exponentially more difficult.

## 🚀 The Solution: Predictive AI-Driven Claim Verification

ClaimAudit AI leverages sophisticated machine learning to detect billing anomalies **before payment**, saving insurers an average of **7-9% on claim payments** while reducing administrative burden.

> *"ClaimAudit AI identified $12.3M in questionable claims in our first 90 days of deployment. Previously, we'd catch less than a third of these issues."* — **National Healthcare Payer CTO**
